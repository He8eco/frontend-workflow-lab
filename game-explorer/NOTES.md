## Stage 6 — Substage 4 — Catalog components

- Created `GameList` component.
- Created `GameCard` component.
- Moved game list markup out of `App.jsx`.
- `GameList` receives `games` through props.
- `GameList` renders `GameCard` for each game.
- `GameCard` receives one `game` through props.
- `key={game.id}` is used when rendering the list.
- `App.jsx` now focuses more on loading state and page composition.
